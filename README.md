# Search Tree

Code for `search-tree` mentioned in McMahon et al. paper on STBase, retrieved from https://code.google.com/archive/p/search-tree/

From original repo:

> Contains the entire source code of the search engine behind the phylogenetic tree database hosted at http://searchtree.org/. The complete pre-computed data set of phylogenetic trees will be around 300GB (1 billion trees). SearchTree achieves fast response times through a combination of techniques from information retrieval, notably inverted indexing, and from computational phylogenetics, especially for constructing consensus trees.
